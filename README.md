# carDealershipSearch
This is a UI concept for searching for a vehicle by different attributes.

Instructions:
- Run "npm install" in the main directory. This will install the express web server.
- Using command prompt/terminal run "node index.js" in the main directory. This will start the web server.
- Open Google Chrome or another web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/.
- Type different values into the search box to try out the search feature.

Additional Notes:
- Modify the JSON array in /public/js/data.js to alter the vehicle data.
- An optional field "image" can be added to the JSON array to provide an images of the cars. The value of this - field should be a URL to the image. If no "image" URL is present in the JSON data then a placeholder image will be displayed.
